Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness consist on declare in the right way a function, varible or argument, when we declare a function like a const that means that it doesn't change nothing.
It's important to declare functions, variables or argument that return us information class avoiding a possibility of change.

like name and specie have const in the function that modifies that parameter.
